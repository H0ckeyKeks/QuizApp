I created this quiz as part of the Complete C# Masterclass by Denis Panjuta (Udemy). 
This quiz was created to learn about classes, objects, methods, member variables (fields) and keywords like "public", "private", etc. 

The program shows a question with four answers (stored in an array) where only one answer is right. The user is asked to input the number of the correct answer. The program then checks if the user input is the correct answer.

At the end of the quiz the user is shown how many answers where correct.

To create the "design" of the title "Question" I used Console.ForegroundColor and Console.ResetColor.
